*blog site that that allows users to create, update, and delete posts*

## What Worked Well
- implementing the components
- interacting with the API and implementing action creators

## What Didn't
- a little challening understanding the flow of redux

## Extra Credit
- added validation of the input fields
- error handling from reducer and displaying the error message on site
